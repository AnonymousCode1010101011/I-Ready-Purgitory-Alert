As of 2/14, this extension has ~70,000 users meaning 70,000 fewer people have to use iReady. Problem is, that barely makes a dent in i-Ready's 10,000,000+ students (0.7%). If your school uses i-Ready, recommend this extension. They'll thank you. 

## How to use/install

The current "diagnostic hack" is [here](https://vault0.netlify.app). Please note this is more of a search function and is not guaranteed to work on every question.

## Disclaimers
<details>
<summary><b>Details</b></summary>
iReady is awful. It's the worst education tool anyone could ever use. I'm fed up with being forced to mindlessly watch the result of a greedy corporation that doesn't try in the SLIGHTEST to make their product enjoyable, or even acceptable. This repository is a collection of hacks and a chrome extension that ensures nobody has to suffer through iReady ever again. The current version has a **lesson & quiz skipper, a diagnostic hack, and a minutes hack**. The diagnostic hack currently is not instantaneous, and questions will have to be inputted manually.

<summary><b>Other Info</b></summary>
while (obviously) I try my hardest to prevent you from getting in trouble, there are some things you need to know in order to not get caught. First, I heavily do not recommend using it in school (as they can see all your network traffic) or even on a school issued laptop (only do it if you have to). If want to be very safe, use your own personal computer at your own home.

Differences/Changes made from ArjhanToteck's original i-Ready Overload include rewritten functions (lesson skipper, minutes hack), newer code is now obfuscated, and portions of the UI changed to bypass i-Ready "anticheat".

As shown below iReady's developer team has hilariously banned the text "iReady Overload" from their site so chances are they're reading this right now
